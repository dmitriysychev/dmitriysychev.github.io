	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p> My name is Dmitriy Sychev, I was born in Kazakhstan and came to the US in 2016 to pursue my goals.
I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in May 2020 with major in Computer Science and minor in entrepreneurship.
During my studies I became a student leader and a mentor for Inventor's Program in the UT Austin, facilitating hackathons and meetings with companies such as ConocoPhilips.
Later I became a TA for one of the Inventor's Pogram Practicum courses focused on Data Science in the energy industry. <br>
