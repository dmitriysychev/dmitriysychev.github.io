				<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Dmitriy Sychev, I was born in Kazakhstan and came to the US in 2016 to pursue my goals.
				I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in May 2020 with major in Computer Science and minor in entrepreneurship.
				During my studies I became a student leader and a mentor for Inventor's Program in the UT Austin, facilitating hackathons and meetings with companies such as ConocoPhilips and Trend Micro.
				Later I became a TA for one of the Inventor's Pogram Practicum courses focused on Data Science in the energy industry.<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my personal development did not stop on this, during my junior year in the UT I became more involved in the research,
				participating in the Undergraduate Research Forum and winning a 1st place and College of Natural Sciences award for excellence and innovation.
